Custom textures are accepted in the form of DDS files.

## What is a DDS file?

DDS is a container format for GPU-native textures. The image data is ready to be uploaded to the GPU.

The image data of a DDS file can use various raw and compressed formats, with some of these focusing on specific use cases.

## Recommended formats

These formats are generally available on all modern desktop+laptop GPUs. For ARM SoC's and such, you may need to do your own research.

Some of the common compression formats and their use cases:
 - `BC1`: When low VRAM use is desired. No transparency. (aka DXT1)
 - `BC3`: When transparency and/or fast compression times are desired. (aka DXT5)
 - `BC7`: When transparency and/or high quality is desired.

`BC7` is recommended for skyboxes, as it shows less banding artifacts.


## Convert standard picture to DDS: Texpresso

Texpresso does not support `BC7`, so if you're working on a skybox, try Compressonator instead!

[Texpresso](https://github.com/jansol/texpresso) is available via Cargo:
```bash
cargo install texpresso_cli
```

Usage example:
```bash
texpresso compress --format BC3 path/to/image.png
```

The resulting .dds file will be placed in your working directory.

## Convert standard picture to DDS: Compressonator

Compressonator is a set of open-source graphics utilities by AMD.
